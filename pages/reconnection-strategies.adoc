When a MuleSoft app starts, a connectivity test runs on components, such as the HTTP or FTP connector, that need to connect to an external server. 

If the test fails, the default behavior is to log a warning message and continue with the deployment of the app, instead of blocking the deployment.

You can modify this behavior by setting a limit of reconnection attempts after an initial failure, and by forcing the deployment to fail when there are no reconnection attempts left.

* Fail Deployment (`failsDeployment`): Forces the deployment to fail if the connection fails and there are no configured reconnection attempts left.
* Reconnect (`reconnect`): Limits the number of reconnection attempts and the interval at which to execute them. For example, you might set a count of `5` reconnection attempts at a `frequency` of every `4000` milliseconds (ms). Defaults to `2` reconnection attempts at a frequency of `2000` ms.

Example of a deployment that fails after 5 reconnection attempts:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Config" doc:name="HTTP Request Config">
  <http:request-conection host="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" port="80">
    <reconnection failsDeployment="true">
      <reconnect frequency="4000" count="5"/>
    </reconnection>
  </http:request-connection>
</http:request-config>
----

* Reconnect Forever (`reconnect-forever`): Attempts to reconnect at a given interval, for example, every `4000` ms for as long as the app runs. Defaults to every `2000` ms. Because there is no limit on the number of retries, no value for `count` is specified.

Example of a deployment that does not set a limit on the number of reconnection attempts:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request-connection host="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" port="80">
  <reconnection>
    <reconnect-forever frequency="4000"/>
  </reconnection>
</http:request-connectio>
